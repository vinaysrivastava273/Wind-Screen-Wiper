# Wind-Screen-Wiper
This repository contains MATLAB code for simulation of simplified mechanism of Wind Screen Wiper and pdf file explaining the mathematical equations required to build the model.

Wind Scrren wipers are present in automobiles to wipe off water, dust and dirt off the glass screen.

We built a simplified model of the Wiper using 4R Grashof Mechanism.

Features :
  1. Wiping Area can be changed by moving the Delta slider.
  2. Scatter Plot shows the variation of Angular velocity ( Higher the Angular velocity, lower is the density of scattered dots).
  3. Real-time calculation of Angular velocity and acceleration can be seen on the plot.
